#Employee Records program

Like the description says I'm just trying to practice my CPP skills.

Its been a bit since I have used CPP so this was a much needed refresher.


To use just compile with c++11 and c++14 flags set:


`gcc -lstdc++ -std=c++1y -o <executable name> Employee.cpp Database.cpp UserInterface.cpp`
